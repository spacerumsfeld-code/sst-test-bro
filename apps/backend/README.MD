### Where we do our backend work.

This directory will house the core of our backend, where most of our business logic will reside. This will be either in the form of a GQL server with a bunch of resolvers that implement our backend, or the model you currently see here of dedicated "apis" construed as an api gateway with lambdas as route handlers.

Either way, the point is that for a better DX we will focus our work here!
